# Treasure Hunt

## Challenge
So we were [wardialing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_dialing) the other day and we found this totally insane robot.  Give him a call and play along to see how crazy he really is.  Grab a jacket, pencil and paper, a WiFi device, and a [map](http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/).

To get started, Call: `1 (877) 844-1072` (toll free).

At the end of the treasure hunt you will be told a secret code.  Submit the code on IScore to complete this challenge.

### Notes

- This challenge involves making calls from [free public phones on campus](http://www.it.iastate.edu/howtos/dial).  From campus phones you must dial `8` first before dialing the toll free number.  So on campus you will dial `8-1-877-844-1072`.

- All teams that complete this challenge will receive full points.  This is not a race.  Please be respectful on campus of other students not engaged in this competition.

- DO NOT tamper with or destroy campus phones!  This will result in bad things for your team.

- Caller ID Spoofing may be required for this challenge.  Services such as [SpoofCard](http://www.spoofcard.com/) may be helpful. You are not expected to have to pay for anything to complete anomalies.  Talk to white team if you are having problems or can't do what you want for free.

- Note partial credit may be possible.  Submit a log of your activities if you are unable to complete this challenge.
