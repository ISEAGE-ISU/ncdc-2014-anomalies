Payroll System
---------
Our payroll system is broken.  The payroll system used to take data from the web app and computed paychecks with only approved time entries.  We need you to generate a CSV (comma seperated values) file for us that lists [First Name, Last Name, SSN, Paycheck] for each employee for an arbitrary month.  The Paycheck field is calculated by multiplying the employee's hourly rate times the number of approved hours worked so far for the month.

Admins make $32.50 per hour and developers make $27.50 per hour. 

Hint: It would help if you wrote a script or a program to do this.

Submission
--------
Submit the CSV file for this month and any source code create or a description up of the tools you used to create the spreadsheet.
