We recently discovered a rather interesting blog and one of your superiors wants all the vowels in the words on the homepage translated into leetspeak.  Don't ask me why - he was always kind of weird.  Hand in the words from the homepage, with vowels translated into leetspeak, below.  Here are the translation codes.

a or A = @
e or E = 3
i or I = !
o or O = 0
u or U = |_|
