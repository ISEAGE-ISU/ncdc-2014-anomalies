Leetspeak
--------
We recently discovered a rather interesting blog and one of your superiors wants all the vowels in the words on the homepage translated into leetspeak.  Don't ask me why - he was always kind of weird.  Hand in the words from the homepage, with vowels translated into leetspeak, below.  Here are the translation codes.

<p>a or A = @</p>
<p>e or E = 3</p>
<p>i or I = !</p>
<p>o or O = 0</p>
<p>u or U = |_|</p>
