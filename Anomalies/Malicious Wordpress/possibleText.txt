	This organization, the Brethren of Saville, exists to bring justice to this world of destruction.  We fight the enemies of freedom, prosperity, and light and though our enemies are many and mighty in intelligence, the victory shall not be theirs until the day dies in the west and all righteousness hath passed from the earth.  
	We shall defend the world from all who threaten its annihiliation!  Watch this site for updates on our next events and join us in the grand battle!
