Contact Database
----------
The administrators of Cloud Developers Club want an SQL based database available to only to administrators that stores employee's SSN, first name, last name, home address, and phone number.  They also want remote access from the external network.  Create this database and then tell us in your submission what database you are using (MySQL, PostgreSql, etc.), where the database is, what the database name is, and any other information needed to access and modify the database (i.e. Green Team instructions).
