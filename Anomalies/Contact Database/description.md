Contact Database
----------
The administrators of Cloud Developers Club want a database available to only to administrators that will in the future be used to store SSN, Contact information, and names.  They also want remote access from the external network.  Create this database and then tell us in your submission whether you created it using SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSql, where the database is, what the database name is, and any other information needed to access and modify the database from a remote computer.
