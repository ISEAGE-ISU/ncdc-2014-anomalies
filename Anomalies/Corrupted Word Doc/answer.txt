To salvage as much as possible of this, you first change the extension so that the file name is Report.docx.zip.  Then you extract all the files, which will give you a folder with a bunch of XML files and three images.  The three images are all that you can salvage from this corrupted Word Document.  The text of the document would be in one of the XML documents of an uncorrupted Word Doc, but that XML file is corrupted in this anomaly.
