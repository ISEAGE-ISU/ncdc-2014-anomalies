John, this would be a perfect night to Saran-wrap Peter's desk.  I have the keys to office, ostensibly to work on my currently project.  Harold, Elizabeth, and Marian will be around, but I know all of them are willing to go along with whatever we do.  I will bring the Saran-wrap, show up if you want to have a part!
